            Four highly talented magicians - J. Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Henley Reeves and Jack Wilder - each receive tarot cards leading them to an apartment in New York City. They discover hologram technology instructions from an unknown benefactor there.
            A year later, in Las Vegas, they perform as "The Four Horsemen" in a show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. Their final trick involves transporting an audience member inside a Crédit Républicain bank vault in Paris. Stacks of euro are drawn into the vault's air vents and showered on the crowd; the trick appears to have happened as the Paris vault is found empty of its recent shipment.

            FBI agent Dylan Rhodes and French Interpol Alma Dray arrest the Horsemen, but release them due to lack of evidence. They meet Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician turned magic debunker. He deduces that the Horsemen used a mock vault under the stage, stole the real money beforehand, and replaced it with flash paper designed to resemble the money. The flash paper burned when the vents were activated, but left no smoke or residue. They also manipulated the participant, who was selected long before the heist to attend the show, and was hypnotized into helping perform the final trick; the Horsemen forged his signature using his credit card.

            Aided by Thaddeus, the FBI follows the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans, where they transfer millions from Tressler's private accounts to audience members whose insurance claims were denied by his company following Hurricane Katrina. Dylan attempts to capture the Horsemen, but they escape. Outraged, Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose them for robbing him. Meanwhile, Alma suspects that the Horsemen are part of a secret organization called "the Eye", a group of skilled magicians who steal from the powerful to give to those who are vulnerable and believe that someone is helping them.

            Discovering that the Horsemen replaced Dylan's cell phone with a bugged clone to remain ahead of the investigation, the FBI tracks Dylan's real phone to the New York apartment, where three of the Horsemen escape. At the same time, Jack stays behind to destroy evidence. Jack loses control of his car in a chase and seemingly dies in a crash. Dylan recovers papers pointing to the Horsemen's next crime: stealing millions from a safe manufactured by Elkhorn Security. After answering a call from Thaddeus, Dylan suspects that Alma may be helping the Horsemen, which she denies.

            The FBI heads to Elkhorn's warehouse but finds the safe missing. It had been loaded on a truck under the orders of a hypnotized FBI agent and intercepted. Opening the safe, it is discovered to be a decoy full of balloon animals. The FBI converges on the Horsemen's final show at 5 Pointz, where they give a farewell message to the crowd. As they leap off the roof, Alma stops Dylan from shooting them before the Horsemen disappear in a shower of counterfeit money.

            The real money from the Elkhorn safe is found in Thaddeus's car, so he is arrested, presumed to be the Horsemen's accomplice. Dylan visits him in jail, where Thaddeus realizes he is the true mastermind behind the Horsemen's plots, having helped them dupe the FBI into following the duplicate safe. Jack, who faked his death with a decoy car and a cadaver stolen from a morgue, broke into the real safe. The Horsemen tricked the FBI into believing that the safe was missing when it was actually hidden behind a giant mirror and framed Thaddeus with the stolen money. At the Central Park Carousel, Dylan welcomes the Horsemen to the Eye.

            At the Pont des Arts in Paris, Dylan meets with Alma, who has also deduced his involvement with the Horsemen. Dylan reveals that he is the son of Lionel Shrike, a magician who was exposed by Thaddeus thirty years prior. Shrike attempted to relaunch his career but died inside a faulty safe during a failed escape trick. Dylan instrumented the Horsemen’s tricks as retribution for his father's death: Elkhorn's safe led to the accident; Thaddeus destroyed Shrike's career; and Crédit Républicain and Tressler's insurance company denied Shrike's life insurance. Alma, having feelings for Dylan, agrees to keep his secret.

                When Life Gives You Tangerines (Korean: 폭싹 속았수다; RR: Pokssak sogatsuda; Jeju for 'Thank You for Your Hard Work') is a 2025 South Korean romance slice-of-life television series written by Lim Sang-choon, directed by Kim Won-seok, and starring IU, Park Bo-gum, Moon So-ri, and Park Hae-joon. It was released on Netflix every Friday, from March 7, 2025 to March 28, 2025.

                The series received widespread praise for its performances, screenplay, and direction. Among its numerous accolades, the series received a total of eight nominations at the 61st Baeksang Arts Awards, winning four, including Best Drama. The series has been favorably compared to the acclaimed series Reply 1988 (2015–2016), also starring Park Bo-gum, for eliciting nostalgia and warmth rooted in the Korean experience.
                
                The drama follows the adventurous life and many trials of Ae-sun (IU), a poor girl wanting to become a poet who was born in Jeju in 1951, and Gwan-sik (Park Bo-gum), a young man who cherishes and loves her. The drama is narrated by their daughter, Yang Geum-yeong.

                Presented in a non-linear narrative, the story follows the lives of Ae-sun, Gwan-sik, and their children split between Dodong-ri in Jeju Island and Seoul between the 1950s and the 2000s. Events shown previously are sometimes shown again in later episodes with greater context to show the connection between different events and characters. Narration within episodes is often given by an older Geum-myeong, poetically reminiscing about her feelings on events of the past.

                The series was developed under the working title Life (인생; Insaeng) directed by Kim Won-seok, and written by Lim Sang-choon marking her return after writing the 2019 KBS drama When the Camellia Blooms. In December 2022, production designer Ryu Seong-hie acknowledged her involvement in the project. The production cost is reported to be around ₩60 billion.

                Aside from filming in Jeju, the production also filmed in Andong in 2023. In 2023, the series faced controversy over nuisance filming. A visitor to the Gochang Academy Farm Green Barley Field Festival reported being restricted from entering a rapeseed flower field due to ongoing filming. When the visitor attempted to photograph the flowers from a distance, a staff member reportedly shouted at them to stop taking pictures. Allegations of bullying by staff members toward extras surfaced in May 2025. In response, Netflix stated that it was investigating the allegations.

                Pacific Rim is a 2013 American monster action film directed by Guillermo del Toro. The first film in the Pacific Rim franchise, it stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro, from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.

                Principal photography began on November 14, 2011, in Toronto and lasted through to April 2012. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. It was released on July 12, 2013, in 3D, RealD 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX, receiving generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its performances, direction, storyline, action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and nostalgic style. While it underperformed at the box office in the United States, it was highly successful in other markets, thus becoming a box office success. It earned a worldwide total of $411 million—earning $114 million in China alone, its largest market—becoming Del Toro's most commercially successful film. The film is regarded as an homage to kaiju, mecha, and anime media.

                In 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju emerge from an interdimensional portal called the Breach at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and begin to attack coastal cities along the Pacific Rim. They prove resistant to conventional military force, prompting humanity to construct massive mecha called Jaegers; each is co-piloted by two or more people who share the mental stress of piloting the machine through a mental link called the Drift. The machines initially prove highly effective, ushering in a new era of Jaeger stardom.

                In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot American Jaeger Gipsy Danger to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed Knifehead. The Kaiju severely damages Gipsy, leading to Yancy's death. Raleigh kills Knifehead and pilots Gipsy to shore alone before collapsing. Traumatized by his brother's death and the stress of solo-piloting the Jaeger, he quits the program.

                Five years later, world leaders divert funding from the Jaeger program in favor of coastal defense walls due to resurgent Kaiju attacks and the rapid attrition of Jaegers. However, the walls are soon proven ineffective when a Kaiju breaks through the wall in Sydney in less than one hour before being brought down by Australian Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by father-son duo Herc and Chuck Hansen. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under Marshal Stacker Pentecost.

                Now working in wall construction, Raleigh is recruited by Pentecost and brought to Hong Kong. There, he meets Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. Four Jaegers remain: refurbished Gipsy Danger, Russian Cherno Alpha, Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and Striker Eureka. Pentecost informs Raleigh of his plan to destroy the Breach by detonating a tactical nuclear weapon, to be escorted by Raleigh in Gipsy; Raleigh searches for a new co-pilot and finds Mako is compatible. During their first test in Gipsy Danger, Mako loses alignment while recalling a Kaiju attack in Tokyo, nearly discharging Gipsy's plasma cannon inside the Shatterdome. Consequently, Pentecost suspends Mako. Raleigh protests, having seen through Mako's memories that Pentecost had adopted and raised Mako after her parents died in the Kaiju attack, and suggests the real reason for Pentecost suspending Mako was to protect her. Pentecost remains unswayed.

                Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann predicts that while Kaiju attacks will increase in frequency, the Breach will soon be stable enough to permit passage of the bomb. Disregarding Pentecost's advice, Newton drifts with a Kaiju's brain, learning that they are a hive mind of bioweapons created by an alien race, the Precursors, for the colonization of Earth. At Pentecost's instruction, Newton meets with black market dealer Hannibal Chau for another Kaiju brain to drift with. During the meeting, two Category-4 Kaiju, Leatherback and Otachi, attack the city; Hannibal deduces that the hive mind accessed Newton's memories during the drift, which prompted the two Kaiju to attack Hong Kong in search of him.

                All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon while Leatherback annihilates Cherno Alpha and disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast, injuring Herc. The nuclear-powered Gipsy, with Mako reinstated, eliminates both Kaiju before Newton is harmed. Meanwhile, Newton and Hannibal attempt to harvest Otachi's secondary brain but find she is pregnant; the infant Kaiju bursts out, devouring Hannibal before strangling itself with its umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering that the Breach only opens if it detects Kaiju DNA.

                Pentecost reveals to Raleigh he has radiation poisoning after piloting a first-generation Jaeger to save a young Mako, and that piloting again would prove fatal. With Herc injured, he nevertheless resolves to co-pilot Striker in his stead. When two new Kaiju, Scunner and Raiju, are detected at the Breach, Gipsy and Striker approach, where the first-ever Category-5 Kaiju, Slattern, appears. Gipsy kills Raiju, but is damaged. Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating their nuclear warhead, killing Scunner and allowing Gipsy to defeat Slattern and ride its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from Gipsy, triggers a meltdown in the Jaeger's nuclear reactor, and ejects before its detonation seals the Breach. Their escape pods surface as rescue helicopters arrive, and humanity celebrates the defeat of the Kaiju.

                In a post-credit scene, Hannibal can be seen cutting his way out of the infant kaiju that swallowed him, complaining about his missing shoe.
